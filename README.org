* Blanket
A tool for measuring test coverage in terms of function-calls.

Project maintainers spend considerable attention and effort testing source. However, without a tool for judging the quality and completeness of these tests with respect to the system under tests.

This project aims to experimentally develop mechanisms for automating the analysis of test coverage.

As an initial implementation, the project simply measures function coverage. That is, what proportion of functions defined in the project are evoked in test files?

** Use
This project is still under development: Instructions to follow.

** Limitations
The measurement of function call coverage ignores the concept of namespacing as a simplifying assumption.
